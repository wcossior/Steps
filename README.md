# Steps

The project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation designed to create a visual representation of sequential steps. The interface consists of five circles connected by a horizontal line, representing individual steps. Two buttons, labeled "Prev" and "Next," are positioned below the steps.
